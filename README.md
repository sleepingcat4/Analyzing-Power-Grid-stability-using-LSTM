# Analyzing-Power-Grid-stability-using-LSTM
A fun project to train Stock market prediction LSTM model with Power Grid stability dataset


## Note

Comment out the import libraries that weren't mentioned on the libraries_list.txt file. Other than that, Everything is fine. It was a fun project to understand what happens when you train 
LSTM model with Power Grid Stability data. In the initial dataset there are a lot of parameters as power out, transformers and vice-versa. And the dataset is Open Source. 

The model was created to have fun and to learn. In future a curated model should be expected with LSTM for Power Grid.
